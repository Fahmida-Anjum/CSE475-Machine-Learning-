Mango Leaf Disease Classification

This project aims to classify mango leaf diseases using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, contributing to improved crop health and yield management by enabling early disease detection. Mango trees, valuable yet vulnerable to various diseases, benefit from timely intervention, and this project leverages image classification to identify diseased versus healthy leaves. The dataset of mango leaf images underwent preprocessing steps, including resizing images to 128x128 pixels, applying data augmentation, and extracting features using EfficientNetB0, a pre-trained model that captures detailed spatial features for classification. The models—Decision Tree and Random Forest—were trained using these extracted features, with Random Forest initialized with 200 estimators and a maximum depth of 30 for optimal performance. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix, were used to assess the models. Results indicate that Random Forest outperformed the Decision Tree classifier, achieving an accuracy of 0.6425 and an F1 score of 0.64, while Decision Tree yielded lower scores with an accuracy of 0.4950 and an F1 score of 0.50. The ensemble approach of Random Forest proved effective in handling the dataset’s complexity and reducing overfitting. Further improvements, such as exploring deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) specifically designed for image classification, and advanced hyperparameter tuning, may enhance classification accuracy even more.
