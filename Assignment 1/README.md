In this project, I have focused on classifying diseases in mango leaves using machine-learning techniques. I have implemented two algorithms: Decision Tree and Random Forest.

Key Steps:
Data Preparation: I have preprocessed a dataset of mango leaf images by resizing them to 128Ã—128 pixels and normalizing pixel values to improve training stability.
Feature Extraction: I have utilized a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract robust features from the images, which serve as inputs for the classifiers.
Model Training: I have trained both classifiers on the extracted features to effectively distinguish between different diseases.

Evaluation Results:
The Random Forest model has outperformed the Decision Tree, achieving an accuracy of 61.88% compared to 41.13%.
It has also excelled in precision, recall, and F1 score, showing greater reliability in classification.

Conclusion: Based on my findings, I recommend using the Random Forest model for mango leaf disease classification, as it demonstrates superior performance and effectiveness for agricultural disease management.
